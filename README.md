### Plugin made for MisterMel's contest
Since time was limited I couldn't implement the abduction to take you to the planet, so do `/abduct <player>` to go to the world.
## Features
* Custom planet generation with 4 biomes to create an alien look
* Meteor showers that have a 20% chance of happening every 5 minutes in the planet
* Toxic rain, will damage you if you're out in the rain
